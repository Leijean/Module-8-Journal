Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A functional 12-and 24- hour format clock.

What did you do particularly well?
The clock works after I had to adjust some of the code

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
By making the clock have a input time based on the different Time zones automatically.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The overall converter classes that have a function on the time conversion.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Some functions and classes utilied in the project are definetly transferable to applications that need to use the same or similar time conversions. If the project gets updated to reflet Time zones that can also be used in other applications.
